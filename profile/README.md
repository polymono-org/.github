# A git metaframework for infinitely distributed teams

### Goals

- Don't make devs lives harder
- Must be as ergonomic as Lerna/NX
- Must be nearly as easy diffuculty curve to adopt as a sprawling nighmare of polyrepos 
- Iteratively adopted as compared to the productivity-killing poly->mono transition teams undergo to improve their repository architecture 
- Get all the bells and whistles monorepo.tools advertises
- Don't use git for the metarepo
- No git submodules either
- Metarepo operates in a permissionless setting with no root user
- Runs on the worlds first global singleton computer for unrivalled native atomicity
- Devs do not 'clone' meta repos. They are virtualised instances of a git repo itself
- Store the state root efficiently, produced from an e-merge.
- Pioneer the concept of e-merges "emergent merge operations" - conceptually unlike a normal merge involving molecule<->molecule, this is a meta-level action operating at an organism level compared to molecular level the repository resides at.
- Emerge - an Organism emerges from the molecules (commits in child repos) which is the construction of ONLY molecules which the organisms creator permits (meta-perms) it to be created from
